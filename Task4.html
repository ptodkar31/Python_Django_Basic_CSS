TASK:

Fill "styling.css" such that all h1 headings use Arial ,
all paragraphs have font size 1.
Additionally create an id called small to reduce the font size to 0.5.
Fill "index.html", such that it contains at least one h1 heading, 
one paragraph and some text to which you apply small (please use a div container).
As usual, please also create the HTML header. Don't forget to add the CSS file.-->
