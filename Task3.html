<!--
TASK: Create a class called  divClass and an ID called divId.

Then define divClass to have red text color and divId to have blue text color

Please fill HTML file "index.html" in such a way that it contains at least two divs, where the first div makes use of divClass and the second div makes use of divId!
As usual, please also create the HTML header. Don't forget to add the CSS file.

Before moving on,  check what happens if you embed a div container which uses divId into the div container which uses divClass.

<div class="divClass"> One div element
        <div id="divId"> Another div element inside the first div element </div>
</div>
